## Purpose
Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality, sharing knowledge, and ensuring consistency across the project.

## Process
1. All changes must be submitted via Pull Requests (PRs)
2. At least one team member must review each PR before merging
3. PRs should be small and focused on a single change
4. Authors should provide context in the PR description

## Checklist
Reviewers should check for:
- [ ] Code correctness and logic
- [ ] Adherence to coding standards
- [ ] Potential bugs or edge cases
- [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Security implications
- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Authors: Write clear code and provide context
- Reviewers: Provide constructive feedback
- Maintainers: Make final decisions on merging

## Tools
- Use GitHub's PR review features
- Use inline comments for specific feedback
- Use PR templates to ensure consistency

## General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Write tests for new functionality
- Document code as needed

## Language-Specific Guidelines
### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write docstrings for modules, classes, and functions
- Use type hints where appropriate

### JavaScript
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for constructors and classes
- Use const/let instead of var

## Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid deep nesting
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Group related functionality together

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new code
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Write tests for new functionality
- Document code as needed
- Consider performance and security implications

## Language-Specific Guidelines
### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write docstrings for modules, classes, and functions
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Use context managers for resource management

### JavaScript
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions

- Use const/let instead of var
- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions
- Handle promises correctly

## Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused (preferably under 50 lines)
- Avoid deep nesting (maximum 3 levels)
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns (separate business logic from UI logic)

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new code
- Aim for high test coverage (minimum 80%)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use mocks and stubs appropriately
- Write integration tests for complex interactions

## Security
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize outputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
